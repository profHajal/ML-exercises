# ML exercises

Solution for exercises from Andrew Ng's course on machine learning from Coursera.
[Link to course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)

There are 8 exercises in this course. Each exercise comes with a .pdf which describes:
    1. Mandatory exercises and optional exercises
    2. Contents of files including in which file to write new code or modify existing code
    3. Additional resources (text files or images)

Additionally, files described in assignment are provided in that exercise (starter code).

**Note:**  Original code was written in *Octave*. My implementation will be written in *Python 3*. 
Besides *Python 3* I will be using [SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org/index.html).
Number of files and names of those files will match original code found in starter code of that exercise.
Any additional changes will be written in respective **README.md** files of each assignment.
